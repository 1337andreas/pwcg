PWCG 2000 - The Password Checker/Generator is a Python program that checks your password against a database of known leaks and generates a new safe password which isn't in any known leaks. 
The user is able to determine the new password's length, 8-16 characters. 

Current features:
-A console-based menu
-Random password generation
-Password length choice
-Key detection to prevent crashing
-Existing password check using HIBP's API 
-Changing the interface language (currently supports English, Swedish, German, French and Finnish.)

Planned features:
-Checking the newly generated password against HIBP automatically
