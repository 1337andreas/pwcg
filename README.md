PWCG 2000 - The Password Checker/Generator is a Python program that checks your password against a database of known leaks and generates a new safe password which isn't in any known leaks.

Features:
-A console-based menu


-Random password generation



-Generated password gets checked against leaks on HIBP before being given to the user


-Password length choice


-Key detection to prevent crashing


-Checking your existing password for data breaches using HIBP's API


-Changing the interface language (currently supports English, Swedish, German, French and Finnish.)
