	    #Prevented the time and information type from showing in the terminal. Now they will only be written to the log file.
	    
	    #Changelog 14-01-2026 (v1.5) / (v1.6e)
	    #Experimental - implemented a logging system, replacing most prints with logging.info() and warnings. Writes to a file.
            #Added arguments/flags. 
            #Language can now be chosen in the terminal with for example the flag --lang sv . This means the initial ICMP test gets translated. Languages can still be changed in the menu.
            # --version flag to display the current PWCG2000 version.
            # --help flag explaining all the other flags. 

            #Changelog 12-01-2026 (v1.4)
            #Closing PWCG2000 in a controlled manner in case a user runs it on an unsupported OS.
            #Added JSON tags for the startup ICMP test and updated the language files in order to support running PWCG2000 with arguments in a future update.
            
            #Changelog 09-01-2026 (v1.3)
            #OS check and internet connectivity test. Uses "platform" to detect whether Windows or Linux is running and pings Google using "urllib" to verify Internect connection.
            
            #Changelog 07-01-2026 (v1.2)
            #Improved portability with import os; correct file path for the JSON files is ensured.
            #Passwords generated by this program are now checked before being given to the user. 
            #The function is the same as when a user checks their existing password; in the code it has been moved outside the menu loop.
            #Added a small time delay to mitigate a getpass text display glitch in the password check logic. Displays correctly on all languages now.
            #Code clean-up with removing multiple or conditions in a row for different languages. (line 51)
            #Language menu now goes directly back to the main menu after making a choice, which prevents an invalid choice prompting user to press RETURN twice.

            #Changelog 03-01-2026 (v1.1)
            #Minor formatting changes for improved readability.
            #Added French localisation.

            #Changelog 02-01-2026 (v1.0)
            #Issues with password length have been resolved. Now passwords generate as they should.
            #Finnish localisation added. Thank you Vilho / saabismi for writing the translation!  
            #Welcome sign in the menu now translates correctly, it was still hard-coded before.     
    

            #Changelog 02-01-2026 (v0.9e - Localisation branch)
            #Added Localisation class.
            #Added three language JSON files that the script reads from.
            #Added a language selection which is accessed from the menu.
            #These changes have lead to issues with the password length and a few text formatting errors.

            #Changelog 02-01-2026 (v0.8b - HIPB branch)
            #Importing "getpass" to hide the existing password input.

            #Changelog 01-01-2026 (v0.7b - HIPB branch)
            #Added the "check_password" function to check an existing password against HaveIBeenPwnd's API using a SHA-1 hash.
            #Importing standard libraries which should work on different operating systems. Tested on Windows.
            #Upon checking a password, the script returns the number of known leaks the password was found in, including when there are none.
            #Password input currently shows in plaintext, potential security issue that will get fixed.

            #Changelog 01-01-2026 (v0.6)
            #Importing function "secrets" instead of "random", for a better generation algorithm based on what OS you have.
            #Try/Except added to the generation logic to prevent crashes when the password length variable isn't defined as an integer.
            #Moved the comments to improve code readability.
            #Added this very list and one explaining the variables to help developers keep track of what's what.
            #The user can now return to the menu without having to run the script again, with a while loop. Waits for user input to continue.
            #Language selection menu has been added in order to template the script's structure, but the feature itself has yet to be implemented.

            #Variables:
            #userchoice - String that acts as the user's choice in the menu.
            #existing_password - String for the user's current password to get checked against known leaks.
            #newpassword - The new password that the program generates, with certain characteristics.
            #newpassword_length - Integer defining the amount of characters in the generated new password. User chooses this.
            #newpassword_characters - String containing the character set that gets used in the password. Defined by the imported ASCII character set; A-Z, a-z, 0-9, punctuation.
            #lang_choice - Defines which JSON file to read in order to print different languages. The value is given to the Localisation class.
